## Requirements to Use the App:

- When user's first open up the app, they are prompted to sign into the app using their Udacity account credentials. These credentials are necessary
in order to use the app. User's can sign up from the login page of the app. 

- The app is now written in Swift 3 and compatible with iOS 10. 

## Other Things to Know:

- Very specific personal website URL's are required when posting your own webpage to the app, otherwise the app will not be able to find the url. 

Core animations, Mapkit, WebViewControllers, and third party api's are used.
